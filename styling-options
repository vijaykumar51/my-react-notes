Options to add styling in React app
	1. Create a css file and import it in the component file. In the component file, add a class to the html element using className.
		1.1. Check for specificity and overrides in different css files.
		1.2. Verify local vs global css. 
		1.3. Check for generated html and css.
	2. Css modules - Create component specific css module and import it in the component. In component, access the classes written in the module using {styled.className}
	3. Styled components - This uses a package styled-components. 
		3.1. Easier to create component scoped styles.
		3.2. You can pass props just like another component.
		3.3. In-build theming options.
	4. Utility CSS like Tailwind. You download tailwind and then directly add classes to the html.
		4.1. Not react way of writing code.
		4.2. Twin.macro enables you to use tailwind in styled component way. 
		4.3. Useful when you don't want to write CSS on your own.
